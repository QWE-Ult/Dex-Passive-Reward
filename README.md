## Overview
`DexPassiveReward` is a Solidity contract that distributes a project/DEX reward token to users simply for **holding** one or more supported ERC-20 tokens in their wallet. There are no explicit stake/deposit calls â€” the contract samples on-chain wallet balances for a configured set of tokens and accrues rewards over time.
